	"content": "Welcome Welcome to the AWS Cloud Security Virtual Event. Virtual attendees can expect two days of security, identity, and compliance learning and community building. Thank you for joining us to dive deep into how AWS can keep your businesses and customers secure in the cloud. Over the next two days you will have access to workshops, sessions, and events to help you gain an understanding of the AWS service ecosystem and introduce you to a variety of best practices that can be applied to securing your environments and workloads running in AWS.\nSecurity and Compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer. AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure which runs all of the services offered and this responsibility is known as the Security of the Cloud. AWS customers benefit from a data center and network architecture built to satisfy the requirements of the most security-sensitive organizations. Customers responsibility, known as the Security in the Cloud, is determined by which services the customer chooses to use.\nThe workshops and other hands-on content we will discuss are focused on the Security in the Cloud and they will guide you through prepared scenarios that represent common use cases and operational tasks you\u0026rsquo;ll face in building securely on AWS. They will also highlight the design principals from the AWS Well-Architected Framework Security Pillar, which can help you improve your security posture. Additional frameworks that will be discussed include the NIST Cyber Security Framework and the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework Security Perspective. Having an understanding of these frameworks will help you in adopting the practices discussed in this AWS Cloud Security Virtual Event within your organizations.\nAgenda  Workshops On-Demand Tracks  "

	"content": "In today\u0026rsquo;s world of modern application development and immutable infrastructure deployed as code, there remains a number of reasons why engineers require shell-level access to their instances on occasion. They might need to kill runaway processes, debug problems on a live machine, or fine-tune configurations during development; all while maintaining a strong security profile.\nIn this session, you will configure AWS Systems Manager Session Manager to provide secure interactive access to your managed instances without the need to expose inbound ports, manage bastion hosts, or manage SSH keys. You will learn how Session Manager works by default and will progressively increase the security posture of your environment by enabling enhanced session encryption, configuring session logging and reducing default permissions.\nScenario You have been tasked with replacing the legacy bastion infrastructure at your organization with an alternative interactive shell-level access solution. You have been given a few key requirements and must develop a proof of concept that demonstrates the ability of Session Manager to address each:\n Secure Access: The solution must communicate over a secure encrypted channel for all control and session data. The solution must not require inbound ports to be authorized (e.g. TCP 22 or TCP 3389). Access Control: Users must be able to authenticate using IAM security principals (e.g. users and roles) and must not be required to leverage host-level authentication methods (e.g. public-key, password, etc.). Auditing: All session activity must be tracked and logged to include all command input and output. Cross-Platform Interactivity: The solution should provide synchronous execution of commands across both Windows and Linux platforms  Environment Setup   Click here if you\u0026#39;re not at an AWS event or are using your own account   In order to complete these workshops, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a valid, usable AWS Account.

Select the stack with the description of \u0026ldquo;WAF Workshop Demo\u0026rdquo;    Look up the Stack Outputs   Go to the stack outputs and look for the website URL stored in the albEndpoint output value. Test access to the site by right clicking and opening in a new tab. Note the URL for your site as this will be used throughout this workshop.\n  While in the stack outputs, note the UniqueId value. This Id value will be used to identify the posture of your site within the automated scanner and the associated dashboard.\n  While still in stack outputs, right click the link in RedTeamHostSession and open in a new tab. This will launch an AWS Systems Manager Session Manager to the host you will use to perform manual scans against your site URL.\n  Website Scanning Environment and Tools In order to test your AWS WAF ruleset, this lab has been configured with two scanning capabilities; a Red Team Host where you can invoke manual scanning and an automated scanner which runs from outside your lab environment.\nThe scanner performs 10 basic tests designed to help simulate and mitigate common web attack vectors.\n Canary GET - Should not be blocked Canary POST - Should not be blocked SQL Injection (SQLi) in Query String SQL Injection (SQLi) in Cookie Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in Query String Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in Body Inclusion in Modules Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Token Missing Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Token Invalid Path Traversal  These basic tests are designed to provide common examples you can use to test AWS WAF functionality. You should perform thorough analysis and testing when implementing rules into your production environments.\n Website Scanning Environment and Tools - Manual Scanning Once you have started a Session Manager connection to your Red Team Host, the scanner script can be invoked by typing the following command:\nrunscanner\nThe scanner script will run each of the tests above and report back the following information:\n Request: The HTTP request command used. Test Name: The name of the test from list above. Result: The HTTP status code returned.  The logic in the scanner script color codes the response as follows:\n Green: 403 - Forbidden (Except for canary GET and POST tests.) Red: 200 - OK Blue: 404 - Not Found Yellow: 500 - Internal Server Error  About Scanner Tests and Colors: The color coding of the tests is provided to help to quickly assess the behavior of your WAF rules against their intended behavior. The goal is to achieve green color responses for all the tests. The purpose of the canary GET and POST requests are to ensure you have not unintentionally blocked legitimate traffic to your test site. These two tests should always return a 200 - OK response.\n What are the results of running the scanner script? Were the simulated malicious requests blocked? As you can see by running the script there are several vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. In the remediate phase you will configure an AWS WAF Web ACL to block these requests. When AWS WAF blocks a web request based on the conditions that you specify, it returns HTTP status code 403 (Forbidden). For a full view of the request and response information, you can paste the Request command directly into the console and add the \u0026ndash;debug argument.\nThe scanner script uses an open source HTTP client called httpie (https://httpie.org/). HTTPie—aitch-tee-tee-pie—is a command line HTTP client with an intuitive UI, JSON support, syntax highlighting, wget-like downloads, plugins, and more.\nWebsite Scanning Environment and Tools - Automated Scanning In addition to the manual scanning, automated scanning is also performed against your lab website. The automated tests are similar to the manual tests but the results are posted to a centralized scanning results dashboard along with the other workshop participants. You can identify the scanning results for your site using the UniqueId found in the CloudFormation outputs.\nYou can now proceed to the Remediate Phase.\n Stuck?

	"content": "Mitigating Common Web Application Attack Vectors Using AWS WAF In the previous Build Phase, you identified several vulnerabilities in your web application. You are now going to design and implement an AWS WAF ruleset to help mitigate these vulnerabilities. In this section you will do the following tasks:\n Identify the WAF ACL for your site AWS WAF Rule design and considerations Console Walkthrough - Creating a Rule WAF Rule Creation and Solutions  Please ensure you are using the improved AWS WAF console and API experience for this workshop.\n Identify the WAF ACL for your Site   If needed, go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home. You will be redirected to the AWS Management Console dashboard on successful login:   From the Management Console dashboard, navigate to the AWS WAF \u0026amp; Shield service console. You can do that several ways:\n Type \u0026ldquo;waf\u0026rdquo; in the AWS services panel search box and select the resulting option Expand the Services drop down menu (top left on the menu bar) and choose WAF \u0026amp; Shield Expand the All services area of the AWS services panel and choose WAF \u0026amp; Shield Once selected, you will be redirected to the AWS WAF \u0026amp; AWS Shield service console. You may see an initial landing page at first. Choose Go to AWS WAF:    In the side bar menu on the left, pick the Web ACLs option under the AWS WAF heading. If the list of Web ACLs appears empty, select (Asia Pacific) Sydney region.  Click on the WAF Web ACL Name to select the existing Web ACL. Once the detail pane is loaded on the left of your screen, you will see three tabs as shown in the screenshot. Toggle to Rules:  Validate that you are able to see a pre-existing rule, configured to block requests, and that your Web ACL is associated with an Application load balancer resource. You can drill down further into the properties of the existing rule, by selecting the rule name and clicking Edit. This rule references IP sets for the loopback/localhost IP addresses (127.0.0.0/8, ::1/128).  Viewing and Logging Requests: In the Overview tab for your Web ACL, you can view a sample of the requests that have been inspected by the WAF. For each sampled request, you can view detailed data about the request, such as the originating IP address and the headers included in the request. You also can view which rule the request matched, and whether the rule is configured to allow or block requests. You can refer to the sampled requests throughout this exercise to monitor activity and look for suspicious activity. Although not used in this workshop, in the Logging and metrics tab, you can enable full logging to get detailed information about traffic that is analyzed by your web ACL.\n AWS WAF Rule Design and Considerations Basics You use AWS WAF to control how an Amazon CloudFront distribution, an Amazon API Gateway API, or an Application Load Balancer responds to web requests.\nWeb ACLs \u0026ndash; You use a web access control list (ACL) to protect a set of AWS resources. You create a web ACL and define its protection strategy by adding rules. Rules define criteria for inspecting web requests and specify how to handle requests that match the criteria. You set a default action for the web ACL that indicates whether to block or allow through those requests that pass the rules inspections.\nRules \u0026ndash; Each rule contains a statement that defines the inspection criteria, and an action to take if a web request meets the criteria. When a web request meets the criteria, that's a match. You can use rules to block matching requests or to allow matching requests through. You can also use rules just to count matching requests.\nRules groups \u0026ndash; You can use rules individually or in reusable rule groups. AWS Managed Rules and AWS Marketplace sellers provide managed rule groups for your use. You can also define your own rule groups.\nRule statements are the part of a rule that tells AWS WAF how to inspect a web request. When AWS WAF finds the inspection criteria in a web request, we say that the web request matches the statement. Every rule statement specifies what to look for and how, according to the statement type.\nEvery rule in AWS WAF has a single top-level rule statement, which can contain other statements. Rule statements can be very simple. For example, you could have a statement that provides just a set of originating countries to check your web requests for. Rule statements can also be very complex. For example, you could have a statement that combines many other statements with logical AND, OR, and NOT statements.\nHow WAF Works After you create your web ACL, you can associate it with one or more AWS resources. The resource types that you can protect using AWS WAF web ACLs are Amazon CloudFront distributions, Amazon API Gateway APIs, and Application Load Balancers.\nIn order to illustrate the process of creating WAF rules, we will walk through the creation of the first rule in your WAF ACL.\n Rule Design Considerations: Use the following guiding questions when planning WAF rules:\n What is the intended purpose of the rule? What HTTP request components apply to the purpose of the rule? Do you already have rules or rule groups targeting those request components that you can expand? Is that desirable? How can you define the purpose of the rule in a Boolean logic expression? Will the rule require nested statements under logical AND or OR rule statements? Are any transformations relevant to my input content type?  Sample Rule purpose:  Detect SQL Injection in query string, use \u0026lsquo;block\u0026rsquo; action in Web ACL  HTTP request components:  Request Method \u0026ndash; form input typically gets submitted using a GET HTTP request method Query String \u0026ndash; the SQL injection attempt is located in the query string  Define the purpose of the rule using Boolean logic:  If Query String contains suspected SQL Injection then block  Sample Rule - Statement to implement:  Contains SQL injection attacks Match type targeting the request Query string  Relevant transformations:  Contains SQL injection attacks Match type query string is URL encoded, so we will apply the URL_DECODE transformation.  Rules to implement:  Rule with 1 predicate Contains SQL injection attacks Match type  Console Walkthrough - Creating a Rule   In the AWS WAF console, create a SQL injection rule by clicking the Web ACL, Add rules, Add my own rules and rule groups\n  Click on Rule builder, provide matchSQLi for the Name and keep Regular rule for Type:\n  For If a request select matches the statement. Under Statement, for Inspect select Query string, for Match type select Contains SQL injection attacks, for Text transformation select URL decode and for Action select Block.   Click on Add Rule, select Save on the Set rule priority page.\n View the matchSQLi rule in the Rule visual editor to confirm it is correct.    For a more comprehensive discussion of common vulnerabilities for web applications, as well as how to mitigate them using AWS WAF, and other AWS services, please refer to the Use AWS WAF to Mitigate OWASP\u0026rsquo;s Top 10 Web Application Vulnerabilities whitepaper.\n WAF Rule Creation and Solutions In this phase, we will have a set of 6 exercises walking you through the process of building a basic mitigation rule set for common vulnerabilities. We will build these rules from scratch, so you can gain familiarity with the AWS WAF programming model and you can then write rules specific to your applications.\nFor the exercises below, you will find the high level description and solution configuration for your web ACL. You can test your ACL ruleset at any time using the Red Team Host. For AWS sponsored event, you can also view test results on the WAF Lab Dashboard.\n 1. SQL Injection \u0026amp; Cross Site Scripting Mitigation Use the SQL injection, cross-site scripting, as well as string and regex matching to build rules that mitigate injection attacks and cross site scripting attacks.\nConsider the following:\n How does your web application accept end-user input (whether directly or indirectly). Which HTTP request components does that input get inserted into? What kind of content encoding considerations do you need to factor in for the input format? What considerations do you need to account for in regards to false positives? For example, does your application legitimately need to accept SQL statements as input?  How do the requirements derived from the above questions affect your solution?\nSQL Injection Solution  Update the matchSQLi rule with 2 additional statements  Select the matchSQLi rule and click Edit (You should have created this rule in the walk through above) Change If a request to matches at least one of the statements (OR) Click Add another statement: body, contains sql injection attacks, html entity decode and URL decode Click Add another statement: header, cookie (type manually), contains sql injection attacks, url decode   Select Save and Save again on the Set rule priority page. Re-run the WAF test script (runscanner) from your red team host to confirm requests are blocked  Thus far you have used the Visual Rule Editor to create WAF Rules but every web ACL also has a JSON format representation. In there, you see these special types of rule statements. For rules of any complexity, managing your web ACL using the JSON editor is the easiest way to go. You can retrieve the complete configuration for a web ACL in JSON format, modify it as you need, and then provide it through the console, API, or CLI. AWS WAF supports nesting of rule statements. To combine rule statement results, you nest the statements under logical AND or OR rule statements. The visual editor on the console supports one level of rule statement nesting, which works for many needs. To nest more levels, you can edit the JSON representation of the rule on the console.\n Cross Site Scripting Solution   Create a new rule named matchXSS and for If a request choose matches at least one of the statements (OR). Add statements:\n all query parameters, contains xss injection attacks, url decode body, contains xss injection attacks, html entity decode and url decode header, cookie (type manually), contains xss injection attacks, url decode Click on Add Rule and then select Save on the Set rule priority page.    Edit the rule, click the Rule JSON editor and note the structure and syntax of the rule logic.\n  Add an exception statement for the XSS rule to allow access to /reportBuilder/Editor.aspx. Note that we are using the JSON editor here due to the nested logic required for the exception.\n After reviewing it, clear the existing editor content for the matchXSS rule and paste the following JSON Nested Statement with XSS Exception Solution    { \u0026quot;Name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;matchXSS\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Priority\u0026quot;: 2, \u0026quot;Action\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;Block\u0026quot;: {} }, \u0026quot;VisibilityConfig\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;SampledRequestsEnabled\u0026quot;: true, \u0026quot;CloudWatchMetricsEnabled\u0026quot;: true, \u0026quot;MetricName\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;matchXSS\u0026quot; }, \u0026quot;Statement\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;AndStatement\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;Statements\u0026quot;: [{ \u0026quot;NotStatement\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;Statement\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;ByteMatchStatement\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;SearchString\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/reportBuilder/Editor.aspx\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;FieldToMatch\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;UriPath\u0026quot;: {} }, \u0026quot;TextTransformations\u0026quot;: [{ \u0026quot;Priority\u0026quot;: 0, \u0026quot;Type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;NONE\u0026quot; }], \u0026quot;PositionalConstraint\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;STARTS_WITH\u0026quot; } } } }, { \u0026quot;OrStatement\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;Statements\u0026quot;: [{ \u0026quot;XssMatchStatement\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;FieldToMatch\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;QueryString\u0026quot;: {} }, \u0026quot;TextTransformations\u0026quot;: [{ \u0026quot;Priority\u0026quot;: 0, \u0026quot;Type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;URL_DECODE\u0026quot; }] } }, { \u0026quot;XssMatchStatement\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;FieldToMatch\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;Body\u0026quot;: {} }, \u0026quot;TextTransformations\u0026quot;: [{ \u0026quot;Priority\u0026quot;: 0, \u0026quot;Type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;HTML_ENTITY_DECODE\u0026quot; }, { \u0026quot;Priority\u0026quot;: 1, \u0026quot;Type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;URL_DECODE\u0026quot; } ] } }, { \u0026quot;XssMatchStatement\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;FieldToMatch\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;SingleHeader\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;Name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;cookie\u0026quot; } }, \u0026quot;TextTransformations\u0026quot;: [{ \u0026quot;Priority\u0026quot;: 0, \u0026quot;Type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;URL_DECODE\u0026quot; }] } } ] } } ] } } }  Click Save rule\n  Re-run the WAF test script (runscanner) from your red team host to confirm requests are blocked\n  If your Systems Manager Session Manager session times out, create a new session.\n 2. Mitigate File Inclusion \u0026amp; Path Traversal Use the string and regex matching to build rules that block specific patterns indicative of unwanted path traversal or file inclusion.\nConsider the following:  Can end users browse the directory structure of your web folders? Do you have directory indexes enabled? Does your application (or any dependency components) use input parameters in filesystem or remote URL references? Do you adequately lock down access so input paths cannot be manipulated? What considerations do you need to account for in regards to false positives (directory traversal signature patterns)?  Build rules that ensure the relevant HTTP request components used for input into paths do not contain known path traversal patterns.\nSolution  Create a new rule named matchTraversal and for If a request choose matches at least one of the statements (OR). Add statements:  uri_path, starts with string, /include , url_decode query_string, contains string, ../ , url_decode query_string, contains string, :// , url_decode Click on Add Rule and then select Save on the Set rule priority page.   Re-run the WAF test script (runscanner) from your red team host to confirm requests are blocked  3. Enforce Request Hygiene Use the string and regex matching, size constraints and IP address matching to build rules that block non-conforming or low value HTTP requests.\nConsider the following:   Are there limits to the size of the various HTTP request components relevant to your web application? For example, does your application ever use URIs that are longer than 100 characters in size?\n  Are there specific HTTP request components without which your application cannot operate effectively (e.g. CSRF token header, authorization header, referrer header)?\n  Build rules that ensure the requests your application ends up processing are valid, conforming and valuable.\nSolution   In the left pane, choose Regex pattern sets, Create regex pattern set\n Regex pattern set name csrf, Regular expressions \\^\\[0-9a-f\\]{40}\\$  The Regex pattern above is a simple example that matches the string length (40) and characters (0-9 or a-f). Copy the Regex pattern set ID into a scratch file to refer to it later. Note your AWS account Id (in CloudFormation Stack Outputs) and region and add them to the scratch file.      Create a new rule and choose Rule JSON editor\n  Delete any existing text and paste the following JSON below. Review the statements in the JSON\n  Update the region, AWS account Id and Regex pattern ID with the one created in the previous step\n  Nested Statement with Request Hygiene Solution\n  { \u0026quot;Name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;matchCSRF\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Priority\u0026quot;: 3, \u0026quot;Action\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;Block\u0026quot;: {} }, \u0026quot;VisibilityConfig\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;SampledRequestsEnabled\u0026quot;: true, \u0026quot;CloudWatchMetricsEnabled\u0026quot;: true, \u0026quot;MetricName\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;matchCSRF\u0026quot; }, \u0026quot;Statement\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;AndStatement\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;Statements\u0026quot;: [{ \u0026quot;NotStatement\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;Statement\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;ARN\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;arn:aws:wafv2:YOUR_REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:regional/regexpatternset/csrf/YOUR_REGEX_PATTERN_ID\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;FieldToMatch\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;SingleHeader\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;Name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;x-csrf-token\u0026quot; } }, \u0026quot;TextTransformations\u0026quot;: [{ \u0026quot;Priority\u0026quot;: 0, \u0026quot;Type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;URL_DECODE\u0026quot; }] } } } }, { \u0026quot;OrStatement\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;Statements\u0026quot;: [{ \u0026quot;ByteMatchStatement\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;SearchString\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/form.php\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;FieldToMatch\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;UriPath\u0026quot;: {} }, \u0026quot;TextTransformations\u0026quot;: [{ \u0026quot;Priority\u0026quot;: 0, \u0026quot;Type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;NONE\u0026quot; }], \u0026quot;PositionalConstraint\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;STARTS_WITH\u0026quot; } }, { \u0026quot;ByteMatchStatement\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;SearchString\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/form.php\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;FieldToMatch\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;UriPath\u0026quot;: {} }, \u0026quot;TextTransformations\u0026quot;: [{ \u0026quot;Priority\u0026quot;: 0, \u0026quot;Type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;NONE\u0026quot; }], \u0026quot;PositionalConstraint\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;EXACTLY\u0026quot; } } ] } } ] } } }  Click Save rule and then select Save on the Set rule priority page.\n  Re-run the WAF test script (runscanner) from your red team host to confirm requests are blocked\n  If you have 30 minutes or less remaining in the workshop, you should consider proceeding to the Host Layer round. There will be time during the Inspector Assessment run to continue the WAF excercises. The remaining exercises below are optional. You should proceed to the Verify Phase and come back to the content below if time permits.\n  4. Limit Attack Footprint (Optional) Use geo matching to build rules that limit the attack footprint against the exposed components of your application.\nConsider the following:\n  Does your web application have server-side include components in the public web path?\n  Does your web application have components at exposed paths that are not used (or dependencies have such functions)?\n  Do you have administrative, management, status or health check paths and components that aren\u0026rsquo;t meant for end user access?\n  You should consider blocking access to such elements, or limiting access to known sources, either whitelisted IP addresses or geographic locations.\nSolution   Create a new rule and choose Rule JSON editor\n Paste the following JSON  Nested Statement with Limit Attack Footprint Solution\n  { \u0026quot;Name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;matchAdminNotAffiliate\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Priority\u0026quot;: 4, \u0026quot;Action\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;Block\u0026quot;: {} }, \u0026quot;VisibilityConfig\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;SampledRequestsEnabled\u0026quot;: true, \u0026quot;CloudWatchMetricsEnabled\u0026quot;: true, \u0026quot;MetricName\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;matchAdminNotAffiliate\u0026quot; }, \u0026quot;Statement\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;AndStatement\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;Statements\u0026quot;: [{ \u0026quot;NotStatement\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;Statement\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;GeoMatchStatement\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;CountryCodes\u0026quot;: [ \u0026quot;US\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;RO\u0026quot; ] } } } }, { \u0026quot;ByteMatchStatement\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;FieldToMatch\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;UriPath\u0026quot;: {} }, \u0026quot;PositionalConstraint\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;STARTS_WITH\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;SearchString\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/admin\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;TextTransformations\u0026quot;: [{ \u0026quot;Type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;NONE\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Priority\u0026quot;: 0 }] } } ] } } } Click on Add Rule and then click Save  5. Detect \u0026amp; Mitigate Anomalies (Optional) What constitutes an anomaly in regards to your web application? A few common anomaly patterns are:\n Unusually elevated volume of requests in general Unusually elevated volumes of requests to specific URI paths Unusually elevated levels of requests generating specific non-HTTP status 200 responses Unusually elevated volumes from certain sources (IPs, geographies) Usual request signatures (referrers, user agent strings, content types, etc)  Do you have mechanisms in place to detect such patterns? If so, can you build rules to mitigate them?\nSolution  Create a new rule named matchRateLogin of type Rate-based rule  Rate limit 1000 choose Source IP address choose Only consider requests that match the criteria in a rule statement choose If a request choose matches at least one of the statements (OR). Add statements:  uri_path, starts with string, /login.php http_method, exactly matches string, POST text transformation, None   Click on Add Rule and then click Save    6. Reputation Lists, Nuisance Requests (Optional) Reputation lists (whitelists or blacklists) are a good way to filter and stop servicing low value requests. This can reduce operating costs, and reduce exposure to attack vectors. Reputation lists can be self-maintained: lists of identifiable actors that you have determined are undesired. They can be identified any number of ways:\n the source IP address the user agent string reuse of hijacked authorization or session tokens, attempting to make requests to paths that clearly do not exist in your application but are well known vulnerable software packages (probing)  Build blacklists of such actors using the relevant statements and set up rules to match and block them. An example IP-based blacklist already exists in your sandbox environment.\nReputation lists can also be maintained by third parties. The AWS WAF Security Automations allow you to implement IP-based reputation lists.\nSolution  edit the IP set SampleIPSetV4  add a test IP address You can obtain your current IP at Ifconfig.co or CheckIP. The entry should follow CIDR notation. i.e. 10.10.10.10/32 for a single host.   Create a new rule named matchRepNuisance  uri_path, starts with, /phpmyadmin, no transform     You can now proceed to the Verify Phase.\n Stuck?

	"content": "On-Demand Tracks Watch the following great talks about AWS cloud security, presented by a mix of AWS customers and AWS experts.\n   Topic Description Skill Level     Introduction to AWS Security Ensuring security and compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer. In this session, we introduce the AWS Shared Responsibility Model along with key security services that allow you to build security controls that are aligned to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework categories: identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. You also hear from a financial institution in Singapore about how they are developing a cloud security strategy that allows innovation within defined risk guardrails. 100   Advanced container security Learn how to leverage the identity and authorisation, network security and secrets management features of the wider AWS platform for their containers, including Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) and Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (Amazon EKS). We also discuss best practices for the security of your container images such as scanning them for known vulnerabilities. 300   Cloud security for everyone: Multi-account strategy The cloud enables every business to have enterprise-grade security. Leveraging multiple accounts is an essential security pattern, even in small teams without dedicated security personnel. In this session, we dive deep into the accounts and learn how to configure them. Attendees are expected to have an understanding of the shared responsibility model and IAM. 300   Cloud-enabled security evolution with Origin Energy Moving your business to the cloud is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to significantly evolve your security capability and culture. Origin Energy, Australia’s largest energy retailer, started its cloud journey a few years ago. In this session, Origin Energy’s chief security officer and its security lead for cloud discuss their experience transforming a largely outsourced security capability into an in-house, business-aligned team. Learn how the company builds and runs cloud-native security at scale, at low cost, and with improved security. 200   Federated access and authorisation made simple In this session, learn how to implement attribute-based access control with role-based access control. We discuss how you can use this strategy to ensure that people have the right access to the things they need in their role, and we show you how to simplify their IAM policies in the process. Also learn how automation can deliver the consistency of access and authorisation, and how you can apply this to your environment. 200   How AFL secures real-time player tracking with encryption Through the sharing of real-time data and insights about the prevailing game and players, fan engagement in sports has been revolutionised. However, the sensitivity, influence, and impact of such data, as determined by various entities in the sports ecosystem, is critical. In this session, discover how a highly secure application has been designed and implemented not only to appease the various sporting entities, but also to ensure data is kept secure. 300   How to put SecOps to work in your organisation Open Universities Australia (OUA) migrated their core business systems to AWS in 2014 and have continued to optimise their environment on AWS. Leveraging AWS tools, OUA have automated responses to security events, limiting intervention of engineering staff, and enabling secure self-service tasks to simplify access to secure systems. In this session, OUA covers what worked, what didn\u0026rsquo;t, and what they learned along the way. 200   How Xinja built a neobank on the cloud Xinja is a 100-percent digital cloud-based neobank composed of a microservices architecture built with Kubernetes and Apache Kafka on AWS and hooked into many modern, cloud-based banking, payment, and channel platforms. This session focuses on how Xinja built its technology stack to exceed stringent security, risk, and resiliency requirements. Learn how it established a contemporary cloud network foundation, delivered transaction and deposit accounts with debit card payment capability, and integrated Apple Pay and Google Pay (including PCI DSS compliance). Additionally, hear how Xinja created multiple on-demand data pipelines and worked with APRA to secure its banking license and revolutionise its customers’ banking experience. 300   The fundamentals of AWS Security AWS offers an ever-growing landscape of services designed for a wide range of workloads in the cloud. But how do you secure all those different types of workloads? This session, intended for security-minded builders, introduces the fundamental AWS security building blocks that can be simply, easily, and authoritatively applied to anything you build on AWS. 200   IAM: Best practices for managing identity with AWS AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to securely manage access to AWS services and resources. Using IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups, as well as use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources. In this session, you learn best practices for managing user identity and permissions with AWS. We examine role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC) models to ensure that people have the right access to what they need to perform their roles. 200   Security best practices: The Well-Architected way As you continually evolve your use of AWS, it’s important to consider ways to improve your security posture and take advantage of new security services and features. In this session, you explore architectural patterns for meeting common challenges, learn about service limits, and hear some tips and tricks, as well as learn ways to continually evaluate your architecture against best practices. Automation and tools are featured throughout, and we also include code giveaways! 200    "

The meanings of the output values are described in the table below.\n   Key Meaning of Value     BastionIP The IP address of the bastion host   DBInstance The Amazon RDS instance id   DBPassword The master password of the RDS data base   DBUser The master user of the RDS data base   EC2UserPassword The password for the ec2-user id   ECRRepository The ECR repository id   ECSCluster The ECS cluster id    You will need the values in the DBInstance, DBPassword, DBUser, and EC2UserPassword outputs in the next section so copy them to a file on your desktop so they are readily available.\nStore the secret In this section, you will store the RDS database credentials in AWS Secrets Manager.\n Go to the Secrets Manager console. Check your region to make sure the Secrets Manager console is operating in the ap-southeast-2 region. Click Store a new secret. Select the Credentials for RDS database radio button. Copy the values for the DBUser and DBPassword CloudFormation output values that you got from the CloudFormation stack into the User name and Password fields respectively. For the encryption key, Secrets Manager gives you the option of using the default KMS key that Secrets Manager creates for your account. This default key is managed by Secrets Manager itself. It provides encryption but you do not have the ability manage the policies or grants for the key. You can also specify your own KMS key which gives you more the option of configuring grants and policies that provide more granular permissions. In a production environment that requires fine-grained security controls, you would likely choose your own key. For this workshop we do not require these additional controls so select DefaultEncryptionKey in the dropdown menu. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and you will see a list of your RDS instances. Select the RDS instance based on the DBInstance CloudFormation output value.  Click Next. Enter a name for the secret. Use smdemo as shown below.  Click Next. Select Disable automatic rotation and then click Next. We will enable rotation later in this module.  Click Store.  You have now stored your secret value as shown below. Access the database In this section, you will connect to the bastion host so you can run scripts that the CloudFormation template has created on the instance.\n  Connect to the bastion host using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager. To do this:\n Go to the Systems Manager console. Click Session Manager. Click Start session. Select the radio button for the instance called smdemo-host. Click Start session.    The scripts you will be using are owned by the ec2-user account. Enter the command below to change your effective user id and directory to those of ec2-user:\n  sudo su - ec2-user  Display the current directory using this command:  ls You will see two shell scripts.\n mysql.oldway.sh - This shell script connects to the database the \u0026ldquo;old\u0026rdquo; way, using a hard-coded password. mysql.newway.sh - This shell script connects to the database the \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; way, using AWS Secrets Manager. View the file mysql.oldway.sh using this command:  cat mysql.oldway.sh You will see contents similar to the lines below. The values PASSWORD, USER, and ENDPOINT represent the hard-coded database password, username, and host endpoint.\n(Note: This code fragment is for illustration only and not intended for copying.) #/bin/bash # mysql.oldway.sh # This is the old way of accessing a database, with a hard-coded password. # This script will only work right after the CloudFormation template runs. # After you store and rotate the secret, you will need to use the # mysql.newway.sh script. mysql \\ -pPASSWORD \\ -u USER \\ -P 3306 \\ -h ENDPOINT  Test the script mysql.oldway.sh using the commands shown below. The first command invokes the script. The subsequent commands select the database, display the table names in the database, query the rows in the table, and exit MySQL. Note that MySQL commands end with a semicolon (\u0026quot;;\u0026quot;).  ./mysql.oldway.sh use smdemo; show tables; select * from bookinfo; quit; You can see an example of the output below. This shows that you can access the database, the \u0026ldquo;old\u0026rdquo; way, with a hard-coded user name and password. You may be wondering why MariaDB appears in the image below. Amazon Linux 2 includes the MariaDB port of the mysql command as an \u0026ldquo;extras\u0026rdquo; module. The mysql program is compatible with both MySQL and MariaDB.  View the file mysql.newway.sh by entering this command:  cat mysql.newway.sh Take a look at the lines below.\n(Note: This code fragment is for illustration and not intended for copying.) getsecretvalue() { aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id $1 | \\ jq .SecretString | \\ jq fromjson } The above lines define a shell function that uses the AWS CLI to retrieve the secret whose name is passed as a command line argument ($1). The result is a JSON string so the jq utility is used to extract the actual value of the secret whose JSON key is named SecretString. Here is an example of what a SecretString looks like:\n(Note: This code fragment is for illustration and not intended for copying.) { \u0026quot;engine\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;mysql\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;username\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;myuser\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;password\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;mypassword\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;host\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;my-database-endpoint.ap-southeast-2.rds.amazonaws.com\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;dbname\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;myDatabase\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;port\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;3306\u0026quot; } Note that the SecretString itself is a JSON structure. Now look at the following lines.\n(Note: This code fragment is for illustration and not intended for copying.) secret=`getsecretvalue $1` user=$(echo $secret | jq -r .username) password=$(echo $secret | jq -r .password) endpoint=$(echo $secret | jq -r .host) port=$(echo $secret | jq -r .port) These lines call the shell function and then use jq to extract the database username, password, endpoint, and port from the SecretString. These are then passed to the mysql command as shown on the lines below. Note that there is no space after the -p option.\n(Note: This code fragment is for illustration and not intended for copying.) mysql \\ -p$password \\ -u $user \\ -P $port \\ -h $endpoint  Run the mysql.newway.sh script by running the commands below. The first command invokes the script. Note that you must specify the name of the secret! In this example, the secret\u0026rsquo;s name is smdemo. The subsequent commands select the database, display the table names in the database, query the rows in the table, and exit MySQL.  ./mysql.newway.sh smdemo use smdemo; show tables; select * from bookinfo; quit; You can see an example of the output below. This shows that you can access the database, the \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; way, using AWS Secrets Manager. Rotate the secret In this section, you will enable the rotation of the secret you created in AWS Secrets Manager.\n Go to the Secrets Manager console. Check your region to make sure the Secrets Manager console is operating in the ap-southeast2 region. Click on the secret that you previously created. Click Edit rotation. Select Enable automatic rotation. Choose 30 days for the rotation interval. Select the Create a new Lambda function to perform rotation radio button. This will cause Secrets Manager to use CloudFormation on your behalf to create a rotation function using the AWS Serverless Application Repository. If you had customized your own rotation function or if you were using a credential for a special application, you would select that here. Enter a name for the rotation function. In the figure below, we used smdemo but you can select whatever you wish. You now need to select the secret whose permissions will be used to rotate the secret. For this Builder Session, select Use this secret. This will tell the rotation function to access the RDS database using the secret and rotate the same secret.  If your application supports two classes of users, for example a \u0026ldquo;superuser\u0026rdquo; and a \u0026ldquo;normal privilege\u0026rdquo; user, you could select Use a secret that I have previously stored in Secrets Manager and use the \u0026ldquo;superuser\u0026rdquo; credential to rotate the credential for the \u0026ldquo;normal privilege\u0026rdquo; user.\nYour window should look similar to the figure below.  Click Save. You will see a message telling you that the rotation is beginning and that you should remain on the page until it is complete. AWS Secrets Manager is now using the AWS Serverless Application Repository to install an AWS Lambda rotation function on your behalf. Do not leave this page until the rotation is complete.   If you see the following error message, goto the AWS Lambda and verify the Lambda function secretsManagersmdemo exists, than follow the above Rotate steps again but this time selecting Use an existing lambda function to perform rotation and choose secretsManagersmdemo Lambda function to enable automatic rotation.  A message will appear when the rotation is complete. Refresh your browser window to update your any cached fields.  Click Retrieve secret value to see the new password value.  Access the database Let\u0026rsquo;s try to connect to the database again, both the \u0026ldquo;old\u0026rdquo; way with a hard-coded password, the \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; way with AWS Secrets Manager.\n On the bastion host, run the command below to access the database using the hard-coded password.  ./mysql.oldway.sh You should receive an error message (access denied) because the mysql.oldway.sh script has the same hard-coded password.  Run the commands below to access the database with Secrets Manager by running the commands below. Note that you must specify the name of the secret! In this example, the secret\u0026rsquo;s name is smdemo. You should be able to access the database as you did before because Secrets Manager fetches the new credential rather than using a hard-coded credential.  ./mysql.newway.sh smdemo use smdemo; show tables; select * from bookinfo; quit; You have completed ths RDS phase and have learned how to use AWS Secrets Manager with Amazon RDS.

You are now going to learn about AWS Inspector. AWS Inspector assesses the instances and identifies security findings that you will later remediate.\nExplore Amazon Inspector You are now going to learn about AWS Inspector terms and explore the Inspector console.\nUnderstanding Amazon Inspector targets   Go to the Amazon Inspector console.\n  Click Assessment Targets on the left menu. Assessment targets represent a group of EC2 instances that Inspector will assess. You will see a target whose name begins with InspectorTarget. Click on the arrow widget to open the target and display the details. You should see something similar to the image below.\nYour stack name will be something like \u0026quot;mod-\u0026quot; and be followed by some additional characters. This means that this Inspector target is configured to select all instances that are related to the CloudFormation stack with the given stack name.\nTags are labels. They are very helpful when you are working with variable numbers of instances. Rather than specifying individual instance ids, you can select the instances with a specific tag and then do operations on that group. In the case of instances behind a load balancer, you may not know the instance IDs, but if they all share a tag then you can work on them collectively by tag.\n  Click the Preview Target button. A new window opens as shown below.\nYou now see there are three Instances that Inspector will assess based on the configuration of the target.\n  Click the Assessment Templates on the left menu. An assessment template appears as shown below.\nYou will see an assement template whose name begins with InspectorTemplate. Assessment templates represent the selection of a target and one or more rules packages. A rules package is a collection of rules that represent security checks. This template assesses the previously mentioned target against the following two rules packages:\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures: The rules in this package help verify whether the EC2 instances in your assessment targets are exposed to common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs). Attacks can exploit unpatched vulnerabilities to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of your service or data. The CVE system provides a reference method for publicly known information security vulnerabilities and exposures. For more information, see https://cve.mitre.org. You typically remediate findings from this rules package by installing patches.\nSecurity Best Practices: The rules in this package help determine whether your systems are configured securely. For example, one rule in this package checks to see if root login has been disabled over ssh. You typically remediate the findings by adjusting configuration settings.\n  On the Amazon Inspector menu, click Assessment runs. You should see an entry for an assesment that was started on your behalf. CloudFormation ran this for you to save time. If the status is not, Analysis complete, then periodically refresh the screen until the status changes to Analysis complete as shown in the figure below.\n  On the line that represents your most recent run, make note of the number in the Findings column (117 in this diagram). After you perform the remediation later in this workshop, that number should decrease. Click on the number in the Findings column. The findings associated with the run will appear as shown below.\nYou will see one of the findings has been expanded to reveal more details. The middle section of the finding has been removed to save space.\n  Now that you have learned about Inspector assessments, you are ready to perform some remediation using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager. You will then run an Inspector assessment yourself to see if the number of findings has changed.\nClick here to proceed to the Remediate Phase.\n   Stuck?

	"title": "3. Fargate with Secrets Manager",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "Prerequisites  You must complete the RDS phase of this builder session before starting this phase. You should be familiar with Docker concepts.  Overview In this phase, you will learn how to use AWS Secrets Manager with AWS Fargate. AWS Fargate is a compute engine for Amazon Elastic Container Service that allows you to run containers without having to manage servers or clusters. With AWS Fargate, you no longer have to provision, configure, and scale clusters of virtual machines to run containers. This removes the need to choose server types, decide when to scale your clusters, or optimize cluster packing. AWS Fargate removes the need for you to interact with or think about servers or clusters. Fargate lets you focus on designing and building your applications instead of managing the infrastructure that runs them.\nThe CloudFormation template for this workshop round created a Dockerfile and some helper shell scripts. You will use these shell scripts to build the Docker image and push it to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), a fully-managed Docker container registry. This guide does not go into the details of these scripts. You are encouraged to read them to learn what they do to gain a better understanding of Docker, Amazon ECR, and AWS Fargate.\nLastly as a reminder, the environment provisioned by CloudFormation is shown in the figure below\nBuild and push the Docker image  If you are do not have a session open to the bastion host, then connect to the bastion host using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager. To do this:  Go to the Systems Manager console. Click Session Manager. Click Start session. Select the radio button for the instance called smdemo-host. Click Start session.   The scripts you will be using are owned by the ec2-user account. If you are not currently using ec2-user as your effective user id, then enter the command below to change your effective user id and directory to those of ec2-user: sudo su - ec2-user  Run this script to build the Docker image: ./dockerbuild.sh This command creates the Docker image based on the Dockerfile that was generated by CloudFormation. The build process can take a few minutes to complete. Wait until the shell prompts you for another command before continuing.\n Confirm that the image was built by using this command: docker images You should see a repository whose name contans -ecrre- that was recently built.\n Run the following script to push the image to Amazon ECR to make the image available to AWS Fargate: ./dockertagandpush.sh This script will take a few minutes to complete. Wait until the shell prompt appears before continuing.\n  You have now built the Docker image and pushed it to Amazon ECR. You will now configure AWS Fargate.\nConfigure and launch AWS Fargate You will now configure the Amazon Elastic Container Service Task Definition that AWS Fargate will use to launch the task. After you confgure the task definition, you will launch the AWS Fargate task.\n Go to the ECS console and select the Clusters menu item. You should see a cluster whose name begins with the stack name you chose and contains the string -ECSCluster-. The cluster description should look similar to that shown in the figure below.  Click the Task Definitions menu item. You should see a task definition whose name contains -TaskDefinition- as shown below.  Click the check box next to the appropriate task definition name and then click Create new revision. Leave all of the current values in place. Scroll down and click Configure via JSON. Look for the list named secrets. It should look similar to what is shown in the figure below. Replace SECRETNAME with the name of the secret you stored in the RDS phase which should be smdemo. Click Save to save the revised JSON definition. Click Create to create the new revision of the Task Definition that includes the JSON revisions. You will see a message saying that the new revision has been created. Notice that the revision has a version number attached to it as shown in the figure below.  Click the Actions button and select Run Task from the dropdown menu. Choose the values listed in the table below.     Field Value     Launch type Fargate   Cluster VPC The VPC that was created by CloudFormation with the 10.200.0.0/16 CIDR   Subnets Select all of the subnets listed   Security group Select the group whose name includes BastionSG    Leave all other values at their current settings.\n Click Run Task . Refresh the Task window at the bottom to update the status. The status will start at PROVISIONING, then change to PENDING, and then to RUNNING*.  Now that you have launched the Fargate task, you are ready to connect to the container.\nConnect to the AWS Fargate container  Click on the task name to display details of the task and note the private IP associated with the task. The private IP should begin with 10.200. The third octet should be either 11 or 12. This private IP of the Fargate task has been connected to your VPC. From the Systems Manager Session Manager session you started above, while sudo\u0026rsquo;d as ec2-user, enter the following command: ssh PrvateIpOfFargateTask Replace PrivateIPOfFargateTask with the private IP of the Fargate task. You will be prompted for the password. Enter the value from the EC2UserPassword output value from the CloudFormation stack. You should now see a shell prompt.\n  Access the database Now that you have connected to the AWS Fargate container, you can now access the RDS database. After you access the database you will learn how the scripts receive the secret value from the ECS Task Definition.\n Run the command below to access the RDS database. Note that you do not supply the name of a secret since that has been passed in the task definition. ./mysql.newway.sh use smdemo; show tables; select * from bookinfo; quit; The output should be similar to what you see in the figure below.   Examine the flow of the secret Now that you have been able to access the database through Fargate, it\u0026rsquo;s important to understand how the value made its way from the Task Definition to the mysql.newway.sh script. It\u0026rsquo;s important to understand that there may be multiple ways to accomplish this depending on what is running in the container. Since this container is running a Linux shell, the path the secret value flowed took advantage of the capabilities of the shell.\n  In the task definition JSON that you modified above, you modified the value of the valueFrom key to be the ARN of the secret that you stored in Secrets Manager. The corresponding name key has as its value the name of an environment variable that will be presented to the Fargate task container when it is instantiated.\n  The Dockerfile that is used to build the Docker image for Fargate has the following as its last line:\nCMD /home/ec2-user/startprocesses.sh\nThis means that when Fargate launches the Docker image, the image will run the startproceses.sh file.\nHere are the contents of the main portion of that file:\ntouch /etc/profile.d/ecs.sh chmod 644 /etc/profile.d/ecs.sh env | \\ grep \u0026quot;^TASKDEF_\u0026quot; | \\ awk -F= '{printf \u0026quot;export %s=%c%s%c\\n\u0026quot;, $1, 39, $2, 39 }' \\ \u0026amp;gt;\u0026amp;gt; /etc/profile.d/ecs.sh You can see that the startprocesses.sh script creates another script named /etc/profile.d/ecs.sh. Each line in ecs.sh contains the definitions of every environment variable passed to the container whose environment variable names start with TASKDEF_. Since the file exists in the /etc/profile.d directory, each time a user logs in, the ecs.sh file willl be \u0026ldquo;sourced\u0026rdquo; by the shell causing the environment variables to be set for the logged in user.\n  To confirm that the secret value has been passed, enter the following command from the Fargate container shell prompt:\nenv|grep TASKDEF_SECRET You should see a value similar to that in the figure below. This shows that the Task Definition properly retrieved the secret information and passed it to the Fargate container which in turn made it available to the login shell.\n  Summary You have completed ths Fargate phase and have learned how to use AWS Secrets Manager with AWS Fargate.\n Stuck?

You will first run an Inspector assessment. While the assessment is running, you will explore some other AWS capabilities. Lastly, you will return to Inspector to see the results of the new assessment to the effects of the patching that you did with Systems Manager Patch Manager.\nRun another Inspector assessment   Go to the Amazon Inspector console, click Assessment templates on the menu.\n  Locate the template that you created during the Assess Phase and check the box at the left end of that row.\n  Click Run. This will launch another assessment run.\n  The assessment run will take 15 minutes to complete.\n  Explore AWS Systems Manager Maintenance Windows While Inspector is running, you will learn about AWS Systems Manager Maintenance Windows. AWS Systems Manager Maintenance Windows let you define a schedule for things like patching an operating system. So, rather than applying patches once as you did earlier, you can set up a maintenance window to apply patches on an ongoing basis. Each maintenance window has a schedule (when the maintenace is to occur), a set of registered targets for the maintance (in this case, the Amazon EC2 instances that are part of this workshop), and a set of registered tasks (in this case, the patching operation).\nCreate the maintenance window   Go to the Systems Manager console window and select Maintenance Windows.\n  Click Create maintance window.

You have now completed the definition of a Systems Manager Maintenance Window. The purpose of this additional task is to show you how you could implement patching on an ongoing basis in your environment.\nExamine the results of the Inspector assessment Now that you have explored some additional AWS capabilities, you will examine the results of the second Inspector assessment.\n  Go to the Inspector console. Click Assessment runs and periodically refresh the screen. Wait until the status for the run changes to Analysis complete. The run will take approximately 15 minutes to complete.\n  Compare the number of findings between the two runs. In most cases, there will be fewer findings in the newer run since patches have been applied. The change in the number findings may vary based on the age of the AMI used to launch the instances.\n  Click the number of findings for the newest run (after the patches were installed). You will then see all of the findings that were not patched during the Remediate Phase.\n  Take a look at the entries that were not patched. A common example of a finding is an instance is configured to allow users to log in with root credentials over SSH, without having to use a command authenticated by a public key. Why would Patch Manager not patch this or the other findings?\n  Congratulations! You have now completed this workshop!\n   Stuck?

Note: You will not need the keys for this lab, they are only required for the CloudFormation Stack to deploy successfully (below, in the section: To deploy the lab infrastructure).  KEY CONCEPT: Management Tools - AWS Systems Manager  AWS Systems Manager is a collection of features that enable IT Operations, some of which we will explore throughout this lab.\nThere are set up tasks and prerequisites that must be satisfied prior to using Systems Manager to manage your EC2 instances or on-premises systems in hybrid environments.\n Verify that your instances run a supported operating system. For EC2 instances, create an IAM instance profile and attach it to your machines. For on-premises servers and VMs, create an IAM service role for a hybrid environment. Verify that you are allowing HTTPS (port 443) outbound traffic to the Systems Manager endpoints. (Recommended) Create a VPC endpoint in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud to use with Systems Manager. On on-premises servers, VMs, and EC2 instances created from AMIs that are not supplied by AWS, install a Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate. For on-premises servers and VMs, register the machines with Systems Manager through the managed instance activation process. Install or verify installation of SSM Agent on each of your managed instances.  SSM Agent is installed by default on (base Amazon-managed AMIs):\n Windows Server 2008-2012 R2 AMIs published in November 2016 or later Windows Server 2016 and 2019 Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 Ubuntu Server 16.04 Ubuntu Server 18.04 Amazon ECS-Optimized  Setting up Systems Manager   Use your account to access the Systems Manager console. Choose Managed Instances from the navigation menu on the left. If you have satisfied the prerequisites for Systems Manager, you will arrive at the AWS Systems Manager Managed Instances page.  As a user with AdministratorAccess permissions, you already have User Access to Systems Manager. The Amazon Linux AMIs used to create the instances for this lab are dated 2017.09. They are supported operating systems and have the SSM Agent installed by default.    AWS Systems Manager now offers a Quick Setup method to simplify configuring your instances to be managed.\n  Click on the Quick Setup link at the top of the navigation menu on the left.\n  Review the Permissions (Required) section. Note that there is a default role, and you can also specify your own role for more granular permissions.\n  Keep the selections Instance Profile role and Assume role for Systems Manager on the Use the default role selections.\n  Review the Quick Setup options section\n  Ensure that the Update Systems Manager (SSM) Agent every two weeks option is checked.

	"content": "Patch Management with AWS Systems Manager  KEY CONCEPT: Systems Manager - Patch Manager AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager automates the process of patching managed instances with security related updates.\nFor Linux-based instances, you can also install patches for non-security updates.\n You can patch fleets of Amazon EC2 instances and/or your on-premises servers and virtual machines (VMs) by Operating System type. This includes supported versions of Windows, Ubuntu Server, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), Oracle Linux, CentOS, Debian, Raspbian, Amazon Linux and Amazon Linux 2. You can scan instances to see a report of missing patches, or you can scan and automatically install all missing patches. You can target instances for patching individually, or in large groups by using Amazon EC2 tags.\n AWS does not test patches for Windows or Linux before making them available via Patch Manager - by default the patches are provided from the patch repositories maintained by the OS vendors. If any updates are installed by Patch Manager the patched instance is rebooted. Always test patches thoroughly before deploying to production environments.   KEY CONCEPT: Patch Baselines Patch Manager uses patch baselines, which include rules for auto-approving patches within days of their release, as well as a list of approved and rejected patches. Later in this lab we will schedule patching to occur on a regular basis using a Systems Manager Maintenance Window task. Patch Manager integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), AWS CloudTrail, and Amazon CloudWatch Events to provide a secure patching experience that includes event notifications and the ability to audit usage.\nThe Operating Systems supported by Patch Manager may vary from those supported by the SSM Agent.\n Create a Patch Baseline    Under Instances and Nodes in the AWS Systems Manager navigation menu on the left, choose Patch Manager.\n  Click the View predefined patch baselines button in the Patch your instances section at the upper right of the console.   Click on the Create patch baseline button at the top right of the console.   On the Create patch baseline page, in the Provide patch baseline details section:\n Enter a Name for your custom patch baseline, such as AmazonLinuxSecAndNonSecBaseline. Optionally enter a description, such as Amazon Linux patch baseline including security and non-security patches. Select Amazon Linux from the list.     In the Approval rules for operating systems section:\n Examine the options in each of the dropdown lists and ensure that Product, Classification, and Severity are set to values of All. Leave the Auto approval configuration item set to the selection Approve patches after a specified number of days and the default of 0 days. Change the value of Compliance reporting - optional to Critical.  Click on the Add rule button to create a second rule (it is possible to create up to 10 rules in the one patch baseline). For Rule 2, ensure that Product, Classification, and Severity are set to values of All. Change the value of Compliance reporting - optional to Medium. Check the box under Include nonsecurity updates to include all Amazon Linux updates when patching (not just for vulnerabilities).     If an approved patch is reported as missing, the option you choose in Compliance reporting, such as Critical or Medium, determines the severity of the compliance violation reported in System Manager Compliance.\n Expand the Patch exceptions section by clicking on the small arrow. In the Rejected patches - optional text box, enter system-release.* This will reject patches to new Amazon Linux releases that may advance you beyond the Patch Manager supported operating systems prior to your testing of new releases.  For Linux operating systems, you can optionally define an alternative patch source repository. You can also add tags to a patch baseline in the Manage tags section (we will not do so in this lab). Click on the Create patch baseline button at the bottom right of the console.  Now click on the View details button at the top right of the console (in the green header bar) to go to the Patch Baselines page, to view the configuration of your custom patch baseline.   KEY CONCEPT: Patch Groups A patch group is an optional method to organize instances for patching. For example, you can create patch groups, for example by Operating Systems (Linux or Windows), different environments (Development, Test, Production), or different server functions (web servers, file servers, databases). Patch groups can help you avoid deploying patches to the wrong set of instances. They can also help you avoid deploying patches before they have been adequately tested.\nYou create a patch group by using Amazon EC2 tags. Unlike other tagging scenarios across Systems Manager, a patch group must be defined with the tag key: Patch Group (tag keys are case sensitive). You can specify any value (for example, web servers) but the key must be Patch Group.\nAn instance can only be in one patch group at a time.\n After you create a patch group and tag instances, you can register the patch group with a patch baseline. By registering the patch group with a patch baseline, you ensure that the correct patches are installed during the patching execution. When the system applies a patch baseline to an instance, the service checks if a patch group is defined for the instance.\n If the instance is assigned to a patch group, the system checks to see which patch baseline is registered to that group. If a patch baseline is found for that group, the system applies that patch baseline. If an instance isn\u0026rsquo;t assigned to a patch group, the system automatically uses the currently configured default patch baseline.  Assign a Patch Group   Click on the Actions in the top right of the console and select Modify patch groups.  In the Modify patch groups window in the text field for Patch groups, type Critical, click on the Add button, then click on the Close button to be returned to the Patch Baseline details screen.   KEY CONCEPT: AWS Systems Manager - Documents An AWS Systems Manager document defines the actions that Systems Manager performs on your managed instances. Systems Manager includes many pre-configured documents that you can use by specifying parameters at runtime, including \u0026lsquo;AWS-RunPatchBaseline\u0026rsquo;. These documents use JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) or YAML, and they include steps and parameters that you specify.\nAll AWS-provided Automation and Run Command documents can be viewed in AWS Systems Manager Documents. You can create your own documents or launch existing scripts using provided documents to implement custom operations as code activities.\nKEY CONCEPT: AWS-RunPatchBaseline Document AWS-RunPatchBaseline is a command document that enables you to control patch approvals using patch baselines. It reports patch compliance information that you can view using the Systems Manager Compliance tools. For example, you can view which instances are missing patches and what those patches are.\nFor Linux operating systems, compliance information is provided for patches from both the default source repository configured on an instance and from any alternative source repositories you specify in a custom patch baseline. AWS-RunPatchBaseline supports both Windows and Linux operating systems.\nExamine AWS-RunPatchBaseline in Documents  To examine AWS-RunPatchBaseline in Documents:\n In the AWS Systems Manager navigation menu under Shared Resources, choose Documents. Click in the search box, select Document name prefix, and then Equals.
